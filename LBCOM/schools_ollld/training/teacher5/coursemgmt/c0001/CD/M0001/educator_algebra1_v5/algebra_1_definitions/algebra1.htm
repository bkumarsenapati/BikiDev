a + b,  a - b,  a x b and a / b, if b is not zero. The set of rational numbers includes the set of 
whole numbers and all fractions, both positive and negative.

5, -7, 0, 3/7, -5/2, -2.77` and 3.628 are all rational numbers. 
They can be written as the following ratios: 5/1, -7/1, 0/1, 3/7, -5/2, -25/9,  3628/1000.

Therefore, the set of integers is defined as all positive and negative whole numbers and zero.

<a name="Distributive Property"><font color="blue"><h1><b><u>Distributive Property</u></b></h1></font></a>
<h2><pre>	This is a property that allows the simplification of algebraic expressions that are being 
multiplied where one or both of the factors is expressed as a sum or difference. That is, for all numbers 
a, b, and c, a(b + c) = ab + ac and (b + c)a = ba + ca, and a(b - c) = ab - ac and (b - c)a = ba - bc. 

Example: 

7 x (3 + 2)			7 x (3 + 2)
= 7 x 3 + 7 x 2 		= 7(5)
= 21 + 14			= 35
= 35

In the first column of the example, the operation of multiplication has been distributed over the two
terms of the binomial. The second column merely confirms, through standard application of the order of
operations, that the distributive process works. The operation of multiplying has been distributed over
the addends, and the result is the same as the result achieved without applying the distributive property.
This illustrates that the distributive property holds for multiplication over addition. 

Similarly, it can be illustrated that the distributive property holds for the operation of multiplication 
over subtraction. 

Applying the distributive property is most useful when dealing with algebraic expressions. 

Example: 

Simplify: 
2(a + b) - 5(a - 2b) 
= 2(a) + 2(b) - 5(a) - 5(-2b) 
= 2a + 2b - 5a + 10b

<h2><pre>	An operation is said to be commutative if the order of the terms, or numbers, being operated
on makes no difference in the result. It is also sometimes referred to as the order property. 

Addition and multiplication of real or complex numbers is commutative. For addition, a + b = b + a, 
for any real numbers a and b. For multiplication, a x b = b x a, for any real numbers a and b. 

Examples: 
5 + 7			7 + 5
= 12			= 12

7 x 9			9 x 7
= 63			= 63

Subtraction and division of real or complex numbers are not commutative. 

Examples: 
5 - 7			7 - 5
= -2			= 2 


Matrix addition is commutative but matrix multiplication is not. 
Examples: 
<center><img src="images/compro01.gif"></center>


The commutative property is sometimes helpful when rearranging addends or factors to make calculations easier. 

Examples: 
45 + 93 + 55 		4 x 157 x 25
= 45 + 55 + 93 		= 4 x 25 x 157
= 100 + 93			= 100 x 157

<h2><pre>	Also referred to as the grouping property, the associative property states that the sum, or product,

for all numbers a, b, and c, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) and (a x b) x c = a x (b x c). 
Addition and multiplication are associative. 

Example: 
Consider the numbers 3, 9, and 2. 

(3 + 9) + 2 	3 + (9 + 2)
= 12 + 2		= 3 + (11)

and 

(3 x 9) x 2 	3 x (9 x 2)

Subtraction and division are not associative. This means that the difference and quotient of three 
numbers does depend on the way that they are grouped when they are subtracted or divided. 

Example: 
Consider the numbers 8, 4 and 2. 

(8 - 4) - 2		8 - (4 - 2)

Every vertical line crosses the graph of x + y = 1 exactly once. Therefore, x + y = 1 describes 
a function.

<a name="Scientific notation"><font color="blue"><h1><b><u>Scientific notation</u></b></h1></font></a>
<h2><pre>	Scientific notation is a method used to express very large or very small numbers in a more 
compact manner. The number is represented using the product of two factors; a number &ge; 1 and < 10,
and a power of ten. The first factor may contain any number of digits but the decimal point must 
always be placed so there is only one digit to the left of the decimal. Usually a maximum of four 
digits is shown after the decimal. The digits in the first factor are all significant digits. The
second factor is the appropriate power of 10. 

Examples: 
32,579 becomes 3.2579 x 10<sup>4</sup>. 
0.000325 becomes 3.25 x 10<sup>-4</sup>.
