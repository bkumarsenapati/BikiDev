<h2>Netiquette</h2>

<p>Etiquette (called netiquette in cyberspace) exists in the wide world of computers. Perhaps just as important as &quot;real world manners,&#8221; netiquette is necessary because readers draw inferences from your  words rather than nonverbal body language.</p>

  <p> Although there is no one set of guidelines for writing and sending emails, here are a few suggestions for you  to follow.</p>

<ul>

 <li>Email messages should be written in a more  formal manner than instant messaging but not as rigid as a business letter.</li>

 <li>Grammar and punctuation should be consistent with rules of English. For example, capitalize the first letter of a sentence, correct spelling, use punctuation marks, etc. </li>

 <li>Do not capitalize all letters when writing as this means you are shouting! </li>

 <li>Refrain from using abbreviations or use sparingly as your teacher may not be able to decipher what it means. (For example, TIA&#8212;Thanks in Advance) </li>

 <li>You may use emoticons to express feelings, but remember there is no substitute for a  clearly written email. </li>

 <li>Always sign your first and last name to your emails so your teacher knows with whom they are working. </li>

 <li>Please  do not send chain letters or spam  material of any nature to your teachers or fellow students. This is most inconsiderate! </li>

 <li>Last but not least, think before you send  an email. You are unable to stop the email after it has been sent. </li>

  </ul>
