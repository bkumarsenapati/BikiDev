  <p>Before you take the practice exam, review all the content taught in the <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>. Feel free to contact your instructor if you have any questions about the material. </p>
  <p><strong>Beware of the following situations in which you could be kicked out of the test:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you are not working constantly in the test, your ISP may kick you off-line. You cannot open the test and then walk away from the computer.</li>
    <li>You cannot minimize your browser during the test.</li>
    <li>You cannot move around in other parts of the course while the test is open.</li>
    <li>You cannot work in more than one browser at a time while in the test.</li>
    <li>You cannot enter the test, print it and then cancel out. Canceling out still counts as one submission and sends the test without any answers.</li>
  </ul>
