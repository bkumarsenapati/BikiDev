  <h2>FRQ Topics </h2>
  <p>The College Board tests all concepts outlined in the syllabus, either in the multiple choice or in the free response  section of the exam. The exam frequently tests multiple topics within the same problem; and questions are often designed to test concepts, not routine techniques. Some topics are tested frequently in the FRQs. If you are unsure of these, please contact your instructor. Below is a list of common topics: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>area, including area of a polar region, and volume using disk/washer and cross sections</li>
    <li>relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration (both linear motion and motion in the plane described parametrically or with vectors)</li>
    <li>accumulation functions&mdash;using the definite integral of a rate of change to give the amount of change</li>
    <li>interpreting graphs&mdash;using a graph of the derivative to analyze the function</li>
    <li>numerical analysis&mdash;interpreting a table of values to analyze the function</li>
    <li>differential equations (DE)&mdash;solving a DE analytically by integration, solving a DE graphically by graphing or analyzing a slope field, or solving a DE numerically by using Euler's method</li>
    <li>power series&mdash;Taylor and Maclaurin series and polynomials; convergence at endpoints, estimating the error</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following table lists the most recent AP free response  questions with their topics. You can see that many questions test more than one topic. For the years 2010 and 2009 you were permitted to use a calculator on   questions 1â€“3. For year 2011 the format changed so that only the first   two questions permitted calculator use.  All of these questions (and their grading rubrics) can be found at the <a href="http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/calculus_bc/samp.html?calcbc)" title="College Board" target="_blank" class="external-link">College Board</a> web site.</p>
