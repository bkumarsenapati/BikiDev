<p>Raise your hand if you hope this course will make you smarter, faster, stronger, snazzier, brainier, cooler, brighter, savvier, sharper...</p>
<p>Alright, alright. Put your hand down.</p>
<p>Good news. It can.</p>
<p>But… you're gonna need the info in this video to help, because from now on the answers to the test are not all in the course. </p>
<p> That's because this course has been updated with the new Common Core standards.</p>
<p>Without getting all technical, the Common Core standards mean students like you across the U.S. are on a level playing field&mdash;learning the same kinds of things in the same grade levels.</p>
<p>But beyond that, the stuff you will learn with Common Core is gonna prepare you for college, the workforce, or both. You know, all that "real world" stuff.</p>
<p>It's like this&mdash;your brain is a muscle. The more you use it, the stronger it gets. And Common Core is like a beefy trainer dudehere to whip your mind into shape. So get ready to sweat, 'cause here's what's in store:</p>
<p>Instead of staring at this, or memorizing what's in here, you're gonna step out of your learning comfort zone. </p>
<p>You'll learn a whole lot more about the world, discuss stuff, write about stuff and sound super smart while doing it.</p>
<p>You'll finally see how what you learn in school can be used every day,</p>
<p>And become a faster, more efficient master problem solver. </p>
<p> But most importantly, it'll help you figure out a question you've been asking since you were a toddler: WHY?</p>
<p>But like anything that's good for you, Common Core is not easy.</p>
<p>It takes hard work. In fact, struggling to find the answer is part of why it's so effective.</p>
<p>No pain, no gain…and definitely no easy A's. </p>
<p>You're gonna need to use all the tools at your disposal, but don't worry, your teacher is here to help.</p>
<p>So do whatever you gotta do: grab your lucky socks, shred some air guitar to your favorite power ballad, or watch thirty dozen cat videos on YouTube.</p>
<p>Just get your game face on. Because some hard core knowledge is coming your way. </p>
<p>You'll thank us one day when you're in the real world, and your brain is a smooth, sleek, well-oiled machine.</p>
