			<label>Antonio is writing an essay on censorship, the act of limiting what is published or what can be read.

Iran, China, Cuba, North Korea, and United States are examples of ‘censorship in’.  Language, ideas, and images are examples of ‘reasons of censorship’.  No examples for ‘punishment for breaking laws’.

			<label>A student writes, “Raising Gators can be a rewarding yet costly endeavor. Take a typical football outing, for example. Tickets alone will cost $40 each, and if you add to that the necessary food and two bottles of Gator juice they will consume to ward off dehydration in the Florida heat, you will find yourself shelling out around $60 for that one event.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The information came from page 12 of Maria Nicholson’s book &lt;i&gt;Bringing Up Gators&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Works Cited entry for that information is:&lt;br /&gt;Nicholson, Maria. &lt;i&gt;Bringing Up Gators&lt;/i&gt;.

			<label>A student has researched psychoanalysis for an essay that he is writing for his psychology course. He has gathered conflicting information. Modern Psychology says, “The psychoanalyst is an integral part of the healing process. He or she can access the patient’s unconscious through dream interpretation and free association and help the patient make sense of his or her past and present” while Wikipedia says, “One suffering from psychological distress can analyze his or her dreams and interpret his or her actions; the psychoanalyst is not essential to the healing process.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What should he do with this conflicting information?</label>

It is not the burning sensation in one’s stomach around mealtime. It is the daily reality that one does not have access to enough food to live a healthy life. Hunger is a big problem in America and throughout the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     According to Glenda Dale, founder of One Source food bank in New York, hungry people are not necessarily homeless people. The majority of the families that come to her food bank have at least one working adult and live in an apartment or house. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     Hunger causes all sorts of problems. Hunger weakens the body and causes those who regularly go without food to become sick more easily. Hunger harms physical development and can result in death. According to “The Links Between Nutrition and Cognitive Development of Children,” child hunger poses additional dangers to overall development, behavior, and school performance. In America one in four elementary school children comes to school without having eaten since the previous day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     Hunger in America is entirely preventable. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, an estimated 92,000 tons of food are wasted each day in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which category best describes his or her sentence variety?</label>
