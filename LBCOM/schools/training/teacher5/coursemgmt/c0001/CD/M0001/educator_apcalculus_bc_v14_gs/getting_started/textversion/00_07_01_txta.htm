<p>Florida Virtual School Welcomes you to Understanding Academic Honesty<br />
  A Quick Start Tutorial<br />
  with a little help from Honest Abe</p>
<p>Academic Honesty means this: work you submit is created by you and is an original representation of your work.<br />
  The Work You Submit is Yours.<br />
  [Abraham Lincoln]</p>
<p> DO your own assignment research.<br />
  DO NOT copy, borrow or steal work of others or from the Internet.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because you must earn credit honestly and demonstrate Mastery on your course's content.</p>
<p>FLVS no-no's: Plagiarism and Cheating</p>
<p> Plagiarism: Deliberate copy of another's work as your own or not citing authorship properly.</p>
<p>Cheating: Rule breaking, dishonesty or giving/receiving work from another student.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>If you're taking a foreign language, your teacher wants to assess what you have learned in that language,</p>
<p>not what can be copied and pasted from a translation website.<br />
  [Bonjour!]</p>
<p>Your teacher uses Proctored Exams, Online Comparison Tools and Discussion-Based Assessments to check your work.</p>
<p>Taking an online course or exam on behalf of another person is a violation that could result in a 2nd DEGREE MISDEMEANOR and is punishable by law!<br />
  So do the right thing: DON'T CHEAT!<br />
