<p>This is a story about grit. And why it might just be the key to your success. </p>
<p>So what the heck is grit?</p>
<p>Well officially, it&rsquo;s the combination of persistence and resilience. </p>
<p>Big words. </p>
<p>Persistence means you keep going even when the going gets tough. </p>
<p>And you stay focused on the task without getting distracted.</p>
<p>Resilience is toughness. When you get knocked down, you bounce back up and try again.</p>
<p>When you have both of these qualities, we call that grit.</p>
<p>And once you have grit, you can learn anything. </p>
<p>But why is grit so important to learning?</p>
<p>Because when things are easy and you&rsquo;re coasting along it&rsquo;s nice. It might even be fun for a while. But you&rsquo;re not learning.</p>
<p>Learning comes from struggle, from trying and failing, then learning from your mistakes. </p>
<p>Remember when you first learned to ride a bike? </p>
<p>Or swim? </p>
<p>Or play an instrument? </p>
<p>Or do long division?</p>
<p>It seems impossible at first. </p>
<p>And if you gave up after the first try, it would be. But you&rsquo;re persistent. You keep trying.Â </p>
<p>You start to get the hang of it. </p>
<p>You practice. You work at it a little bit at a time. And eventually it starts to get easier for you.</p>
<p>You learn from your mistakes and the more you work, the easier it gets.</p>
<p>But learning&rsquo;s hard work. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you need grit. Because the key to success in school and life is how you react when things don&rsquo;t go your way. </p>
<p>So the next time you&rsquo;re struggling with something in your life, or in your science book, just remember, it&rsquo;s part of learning. </p>
<p>And with a little hard work and a lot of grit, you can do things that once seemed impossible. </p>
