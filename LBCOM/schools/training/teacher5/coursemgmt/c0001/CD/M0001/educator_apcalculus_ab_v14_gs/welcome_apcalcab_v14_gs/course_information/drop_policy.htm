<h2>Student Contact and Drop Policy</h2>

  <p>Your online school sets high expectations for the success of its students. We are committed to meeting the needs of all students and will work tirelessly to facilitate student success.</p>
  
  <p>To maintain instructional momentum, students are required to submit assignments in their course on a weekly basis and to maintain regular contact with their instructors. Any student who does not make progress in the course for a period of 14 days and has not made prior arrangements with their instructor will be referred to the Student Success Center in attempt to reconnect the student with the course instructor.</p>
  
  <p>The Student Success Center will attempt to reconnect the student and parent with the course instructor to create a Success Plan for the student. Failure to respond to the Student Success Centerâ€™s attempts to contact the student, or failure to adhere to the Success Plan created by the student and family may result in Administrative Removal from the course with an F grade.</p>
  
<p>(Disclaimer: Local district/local school drop policies supersede.)</p>
