      <li>A box is to be constructed from a sheet of cardboard that is 20 cm by 60 cm, by cutting out squares of length x by x from each corner and bending up the sides. What is the maximum volume this box could have?<br/>
        <br/>
      </li>
      <li>Find the amplitude and period of y = &#8211;3cos(2x + 3). <br/>
        Use your calculator to graph the function and state its symmetry.<br/>
        Find the first positive x-intercept using your calculatorâ€™s zero function. <br/>
        <br/>
      </li>
      <li>Find two functions f(x) and g(x) such that f[g(x)] = x but g[f(x)] does not equal x. <br/>
        <br/>
      </li>
      <li class="math">State the vertical, horizontal asymptotes and zeros of the rational function, f(x) = ${x^2+3x+2}/{x^2+5x+4}$.<br/>
        <br/>
        Why is there no zero at x = &#8211;1? <br/>
        <br/>
      </li>
      <li>Give an example and explain why a polynomial can have fewer x-intercepts than its number of roots.<br/>
        <br/>
      </li>
