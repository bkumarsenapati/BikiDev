	<h3>Synchronous Collaboration</h3>

	<p>Contact your instructor to learn about collaboration opportunities that will allow you to interact with your classmates online, in real-time, using Web 2.0 tools. If you choose to participate in the synchronous collaboration opportunity, your instructor will explain what you need to submit for grading.</p>

	<h3>Asynchronous Collaboration</h3>

To participate in this collaboration, use the discussion board and/or <span class="lang" data-term="email">email</span> feature of the course to send a message to your classmates to find a peer review partner. Once you have found someone to work with, you will send your writing, and your classmate will review it using the <strong>Guide for Peer Review</strong> provided in the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>.</p>
