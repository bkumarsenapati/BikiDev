  <h2>Calculators</h2>
  <p>Calculators are permitted on parts of both the multiple choice and free response exams. </p>
  <p>In Section I, multiple choice, you may use a calculator for Part B, the second half of the section. Note, however, that although Part B consists of 17 questions, less than half of them will actually require using a calculator.</p>
  <p>After finishing Section I, Part B, you will be given a 10-minute break before starting Section II. You will begin Section II with the two free response  calculator-active questions, although not all parts of each question will actually require using a calculator. </p>
  <h3>Permitted Calculators</h3>
  <p>You are allowed to take in and use <strong>two</strong> graphing calculators on the AP Calculus BC Exam. You may <strong>not</strong> use a scientific (nongraphing) calculator. The College Board is very specific about the calculator models that it permits, and there is a list that can be found at the <a href="http://l.flvsgl.com/GSL09a2c034188bf9d61cbbce6778b8d1fe4" title="College Board" target="_blank" class="external-link">College Board</a> web site.</p>
  <p>The College Board also states:  &quot;Additionally, you cannot use any graphing calculator models with these features or capabilities: QWERTY (typewriter-like) keypad as part of hardware or software (e.g., TI-92 Plus, Voyage 200); pen-input, stylus or touch-screen (e.g., PalmPilot, personal digital assistant, Casio ClassPad); wireless or Bluetooth capabilities; paper tapes; talk or make noise; require an electrical outlet; have cell phone, audio, or video recording capability; can access the Internet; or camera or scanning capability. Also, the use of hardware peripherals with an approved calculator is prohibited.&quot;</p>
  <p>Your calculatorâ€™s memory does not have to be cleared.</p>
  <p>Your exam proctor will check that your calculator(s) meet the College Board requirements.</p>
  <h3>Calculator Operations</h3>
  <p>The College Board permits you to use your graphing calculator to perform the following four operations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>plot the graph of a function within an arbitrary viewing window</li>
    <li>find the zeros of functions (solve equations numerically)</li>
    <li>numerically calculate the derivative of a function</li>
    <li>numerically calculate the value of a definite integral</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This means you do not have to show any computational work for these four operations. For example, if you are asked to find f &prime;(3) for a given function, f(x), you do not have to show where you find f &prime;(x) or the work of evaluating the derivative at x = 3. You may simply write f &prime;(3) = ___. </p>
  <p>However, be careful! Do not use any calculator notation on your exam. The grader will not give credit for nDeriv(f(x),x,3) when you should write f &prime;(3).</p>
  <p>Make sure that you know how to use your calculator to perform the four permitted operations. Calculators frequently have multiple ways to perform an operation; use the method with which you are most comfortable. One technique that is helpful for all models is to use the variable store feature. Rather than retyping a complicated function several times (to calculate a derivative or to evaluate a definite integral, for example), you should type the function into the graphing screen, and then access the function by typing Y<sub>1</sub> , Y<sub>2</sub> etc.</p>
  <p>Often in an area/volume problem, you will need to find the points of intersection of two curves. This is included in the permitted calculator operation of finding the zeros of a function, because the solution to f(x) = g(x) could be interpreted as solving f(x) &ndash; g(x) = 0. We recommend carrying five decimal places for the point of intersection (or for any intermediate calculations), and then storing this value into the calculator's memories A and B. Then, when you evaluate the integral, you can just use, for example, FnInt(Y<sub>1</sub> &#8722; Y<sub>2</sub>,x, A, B). Again, of course, make sure that you write the correct integral notation in your work, not the calculator syntax. However, if you first write A = &hellip; and B = &hellip;  you may use A and B for the limits of integration on your paper.</p>
