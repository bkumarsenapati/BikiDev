        <br/>

      <li>Find the particular solution y = f(x) to the given differential equation with the initial condition f(0) = 4.<br/>

        <br/>

      </li>

    </ol>

    <p>Use the following information for Questions 4 and 5.</p>

    <p>Newtonâ€™s law of cooling states that the rate of cooling of an object is proportional to the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings. So the rate of cooling for a bottle of lemonade at a room temperature of 75&deg;F which is placed into a refrigerator with temperature of 38&deg;F can be modeled by <img src="../images/07_04_01/07_04_01d.gif" class="skipimg" alt="dT dt equals k times the quantity T minus 38 " /> where T(t) is the temperature of the lemonade after t minutes and T(0) = 75. After 30 minutes the lemonade has cooled to 60&deg;F, so T(30) = 60.</p>

    <ol start="4">

      <li>To the nearest degree, what is the temperature of the lemonade after an <strong>additional</strong> 30 minutes? <br/>

        <br/>

      </li>

      <li>To the nearest minute, how long does it take for the lemonade to cool to 55&deg;F? </li>

    </ol>
